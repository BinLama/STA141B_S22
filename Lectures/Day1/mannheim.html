# Recap of R


+ I'm using R in a terminal
   + technically in a terminal within an editor within a terminal.
+ Same R as in RStudio - base R.

# Background Context

+ Predict geolocation of mobile device based on signal strength to Wifi routers in building
  + Understand effect of body being between device and router, reducing signal.

+ Build signal-strength map in building.
  + Researchers went through building measuring strength of router signals at each location on a 1 meter grid.
  + Measure signal strength then rotate/turn and repeat
  + Signals for all 360 degrees
  + Move to next point on grid.

+ Signal strength reduced by distance from router, walls, ...

# Simplified Data Record

```
# timestamp=2006-02-11 08:31:58
# usec=250
# minReadings=110
t=1139643118358;id=00:02:2D:21:0F:33;pos=0.0,0.0,0.0;degree=0.0;00:14:bf:b1:97:8a=-38,2437000000,3;00:14:bf:b1:97:90=-56,2427000000,3;
```

+ Data for all of record 
    + t - time of measurement (milliseconds from Jan 1, 1970)
    + id - MAC (media access control) address of researcher's hand-held device.
        + Same throughout
    + pos - x, y, z (elevation) coordinates of researcher's device
    + degree - rotation of device


+ Detected devices and signal strengths
```
00:14:bf:b1:97:8a=-38,2437000000,3
```

+ 00:14... -  MAC of detected device
+ -38  - signal strength 
+ 24370.. - broadcast channel
+ 3  - mobile or fixed location.

# Multiple Detected Devices per Record

+ There may be many devices detected at any time
+ Different number for each record

+ How do arrange these into a data.frame we can 


---

# Representing this Data

+ Before reading, need to determine how we want to represent the data.

+ Wide form

  + time, x, y, z, degree, MAC1 signal, channel, type, MAC2 signal, channel, type, MAC3 ....
    + don't know the number or MAC values of detected devices.
    + different number for each time value
    + lots of NAs when not detected

---

# Long and narrow form

+ Repeat time, x, y, z, degree for each MAC detected along with signal, channel, type
```
time x  y z
```
