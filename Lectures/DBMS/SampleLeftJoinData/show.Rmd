# Self (LEFT) JOINs and Multiple JOINs


Consider the following simple example of Posts and Comments.


![](SampleData.svg)

The second column  - column A - shows the questions.
There are 3.

The Answers column - column B - shows the answers corresponding to each question.
Each answer is a green line.

Column C shows the comments associated with each Answer.
Each comment for answer is red.

Finally, column D is show on the left to connect it to the Questions.
This column shows the comments that are associated with each question.
Each comment here is colored yellow.


Our ultimate goal is to (LEFT) JOIN the 
Posts table with itself and then with Comments and again with Comments.

The idea is that we will start with a tuple for each question.
For one question, we will  combine this tuple  with the tuples in Posts for all of the answers to
this question.  
```
A.Id = B.ParentId
```
Let's call this table StepAB


+ For Question 1, we will have 3 tuples corresponding to the 3 answers.
  The Question 1 tuple will be repeated 3 times to be combined with these 3 answer tuples.

+ For Question 2, there are no answers. The tuple for the second set of Posts columns will be all
  `NULL` values.

Next, we combine all of these tuples with the tuples from Comments.
However, we don't want all possible combinations.
Instead, we want the tuples from  StepAB to be combined with the tuples in
Comments that correspond to the Answer part of the StepAB tuple.
For this, we want
```
B.Id = C.PostId
```

We call this StepABC.

+ The tuple for Question 1 x Answer 1 will be repeated 2 times since there are 2 comments for Answer 1.

+ The tuple for Question 1 x Answer 2  will be padded with NULL values for the Comments as there is no
  comment for Answer 2.


Lastly, we want to have comments that were on a given question.
This will again, be a combination of all the corresponding tuples in StepABC with the corresponding
comments.
We (LEFT) JOIN StepABC with Comments, this time with
```
A.Id = D.PostId
```


We will now do this explicitly with SQL commands.
I'll show the SQL, but I run it in R as it prints the results much better 
than sqlite3's terminal does, even with
```
.headers on
.mode tabs
```
It doesn't align the NULL values well.


If you want to play along with this,
you can download the [sample database](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/17035735/download?download_frd=1).

You can also download the following files:
+ [Posts.csv](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/17035733/download?download_frd=1)
+ [Comments.csv](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/17035732/download?download_frd=1)
+ [setup.sql](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/files/17035734/download?download_frd=1) - SQL code to create the database

If these files are in the same directory, you can run the shell command to start sqlite3
```
sqlite3 test
.read setup.sql
.exit
```


<!--
```r
library(RSQLite)
db = dbConnect(SQLite(), "test")
options(width = 200)
```
-->


```sql
SELECT *
FROM Posts AS p1
LEFT JOIN Posts AS p2
       ON  p1.Id = p2.ParentId
ORDER BY p1.Id;
```


```

8  21    1             Q3 22    2       21    A4
9  21    1             Q3 23    2       21    A5
10 21    1             Q3 24    2       21    A6
11 21    1             Q3 25    2       21    A7
12 22    2       21    A4 NA   NA       NA  <NA>
13 23    2       21    A5 NA   NA       NA  <NA>
14 24    2       21    A6 NA   NA       NA  <NA>
15 25    2       21    A7 NA   NA       NA  <NA>
```

Note that we have Answers in the Questions part (first 4 columns) of  the result.
We could remove these by keeping only the tuples with `p1.Id = 1`.

We might also consider using `ParentId IS NULL` to identify questions
as a question doesn't have a ParentId.



```sql
SELECT *
FROM Posts AS p1
LEFT JOIN Posts AS p2
       ON  p1.Id = p2.ParentId
WHERE p1.Type = 1
ORDER BY p1.Id;
```


```

2  1    1             Q1  3    2        1    A2
3  1    1             Q1  4    2        1    A3
4 11    1             Q2 NA   NA       NA  <NA>
5 21    1             Q3 22    2       21    A4
6 21    1             Q3 23    2       21    A5
7 21    1             Q3 24    2       21    A6
8 21    1             Q3 25    2       21    A7
```


Next, we perform a  LEFT JOIN with Comments on the answers

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Posts AS p1
LEFT JOIN Posts AS p2
       ON  p1.Id = p2.ParentId
LEFT JOIN Comments AS c1
       ON  p2.Id = c1.PostId
WHERE p1.Type = 1
ORDER BY p1.Id;
```

We should have
+ 6  tuples corresponding to Q1
+ 1 tuple corresponding to Q2
+ 9 tuples corresponding to Q3


```

From this, you can compute the the
number of answers, the number

## Number of Answers per Question

Now let's calculate the number of answers for each question

We should get

+ Q1, 3 answers
+ Q2, 0 answers
+ Q3, 4 answers

We clearly have 12 rows for Q1.
How many DISTINCT values of Answer Id values do we have 
This is the 5th column and within the rows for Q1, we have values 2, 3, 4 
and so 3 answers.

For the row corresponding to Q2, we have an NA and we ignore this
as `COUNT(DISTINCT )` does.

So `COUNT(DISTINCT p2.Id)` gives us the number of answers to each question
when we `GROUP BY p1.Id`, i.e., by Question.


## Number of Comments Per Question

We should get
+ Q1 = 2
+ Q2 = 1
+ Q3 = 0


We look at the Id column in the final/second Comments table that was merged, i.e., Comments (Question).

For Q1, we have 2 distinct Ids - 1, 2

For Q2,we have a single tuple and the c2.Id value is 8.  So we have one legitimate comment.

For Q3, we have only `NA` values, so a count of 0 comments.


So `COUNT(DISTINCT c2.Id)`  will give us the number of comments on the question 
when we `GROUP BY p1.Id`.


## Number of Comments Per Answer

For the answers, we should have
+ A1 = 2
+ A2 = 0
+ A3 = 3
+ A4 = 0
+ A5 = 3
+ A6 = 1
+ A7 = 4

Again, `COUNT(DISTINCT c1.Id)` gives us these counts.



## Putting it All Together

```sql
SELECT p1.Id AS QId, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT p2.Id) AS NumAns, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT c1.Id) AS NumAnswerComments, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT c2.Id) AS NumQuestionComments
FROM Posts AS p1
LEFT JOIN Posts AS p2
       ON  p1.Id = p2.ParentId
LEFT JOIN Comments AS c1
       ON  c1.PostId = p2.Id
LEFT JOIN Comments AS c2
       ON  c2.PostId = p1.Id       
WHERE p1.Type = 1
GROUP BY p1.Id
ORDER BY QId;
```

```
  QId NumAns NumAnswerComments NumQuestionComments
1   1      3                 5                   2
2  11      0                 0                   1
3  21      4                 8                   0
```
