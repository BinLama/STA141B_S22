# Regular Expressions

+ Pattern matching in text.
+ Very common in data manipulation
  + Typically small part of a larger step
  + But essential tool & skill
  
+ Use them in 
  + R, Python, Perl, MATLAB, ...  
  + (UNIX) shell

---
# Conceptual Operations & R Functions

+ Find lines/records containing a specific pattern  - `grep()` & `grepl()`
+ Find where in a string the pattern is located - `gregexpr()`
+ extract the matching patterns  - `regmatches()`
+ replace/substitute  - `sub()` & `gsub()`
+ split a string with a pattern as the separator - `strsplit()`

---
# Pattern and Character Vector
+ Most of these take
  +  the pattern to look for
  +  a character vector 
+ Vectorized functions so process each element of character vector separately
  + give results for entire vector.

---
# Specifying Pattern

+ Can be a simple literal string to find, e.g.
   + `grep("cat", c("catalog", "two cats", "concatenate"))`
   + `grep("#", readLines("offline"))`

---
# More Flexible, Precise Pattern

+ But we want more precise description of concepts  in pattern
   + match any character  - `.`
   + match one of several characters  - `[a&#]`  & character classes (e.g. [[:digits:]]
      + ranges - `[0-5]`, `[a-zA-Z]`
      + negation - not in this set of characters  - `[^0-9]
      + named character classes, e.g. `[[:space:]]`, `[01[:alpha:]]`
	    + adapts to alphabet of the computer being used.
   + match either pattern.A or pattern.B at the same place  - `(ABC|other)`   (ABC|something else|everything)
   + match at the start of the string - `^`
   + match at the end of the string  - `$`
   + match the pattern 
      + optionally - can be be present or not - `?`
	  + zero or more times - `*`
	  + at least once   - `+`
      + exactly n times   - `{n}`   .{10}   [0-9]+[.]0{2}  "[0-9]+\\.0{2}"   123.00  123a00
	  + more than n times - `{n,}`
	  + between m and n times (inclusive) - `{m,n}`
---
# Continued

+ back-references () and \1, \2
   
+ meta-characters - ., ^, $, *, ?, +, {, }, [, ], | and \

+ escaping special/meta characters
   + Use \\ before special character, e.g., "\\$"

---
# Ubiquity
   
+ These features are in every regular expression language 
+ Also high-level descriptions of, e.g., word boundary, digit, ...
+ Additional features in different dialects, e.g. the perl dialect built into R.
   + Can be useful but not necessary to master.

+ There are many web sites with short summaries/cheat-sheets of the language.
   + e.g., [https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/)


---
# Greedy matching

+ By default, a regular expression will match as far as it can.
+ Each term will match as much as it can
  + doesn't give back characters to allow subsequet terms in regular expression to match more.

---
# AND in Regular Expressions
+  match pattern that has pattern1  AND pattern2.
  + in that order
```
grep("pattern1.*pattern2", x)
```
  + in either order
```
grep("(pattern1.*pattern2|pattern2.*pattern1)", x)
```

  + Or perhaps better (but different)
```
grepl("pattern1", x) & grepl("pattern2", x)
```  


---
# Contains specific words
+ Can do with word boundaries in the pattern
```
grep("cat\\b", c("catalog", "a cat on a mat"))
```

+ But
```
x = c("catalog", "a cat on a mat", "c() stands for concat")
grep("cat\\b", x)
```
  + does match end of string - good
  + but also matches `cat` in `concat`
```
gregexpr("cat\\b", x[3])
```  

+ So use word boundary before and after
```
grep("\\bcat\\b", x)
```

+ For a collection of several words
```
grep("\\b(cat|dog|mouse)\\b", c("catalog", "a cat on a mat", "a mouse tail"))
```

---
# Contains Any of Large Collection of Words

+ Suppose we have a large collection of words that we computed previously,
     + e.g. specific words used in the State of Union speeches 1900-1910.

+ want to see where they are used in recent State of Union speeches
    + Don't want to manually type them into a regular expression
	 
+ Looking for, e.g.,  
```
terms = c("security", "war", "peace", "justice", "rights", "liberty", "tax")
```
+ State of the Union speech
```
sou = readLines("StateOfUnion")
```
   + Combine lines into one string, adding space for blank lines between paragraphs
```
sou[ sou == "" ] = " "
sou2 = paste(sou, collapse = "")
```

   + Create search pattern for words programmatically
```
rx = sprintf("\\b(%s)\\b", paste(terms, collapse = "|"))
m = gregexpr(rx, sou2)
regmatches(sou2, m)
```

---
# Alternative approach

+ Break the text into words
```
w = strsplit(sou2, "[[:space:]]+")[[1]]
```

+  Split on punctuation also?
  + Or remove afterwards
```
w1 = strsplit(sou2, "[[:space:][:punct:]]+")[[1]]
```
```
w = strsplit(sou2, "[[:space:]]+")[[1]]
w2 = gsub("[[:punct:]]+$", "",  w)
```
   + Should we replace with "" or " " (space)?

```
m = match(terms, w2)  # wrong - just matching the first occurrence. Backwards
```

```
w2[ w2 %in% terms ]
```



+  If we didn't replace blank lines with a space before we `paste(, collapse = "")` to create sou2, we would miss "liberty" as it becomes liberty.And
