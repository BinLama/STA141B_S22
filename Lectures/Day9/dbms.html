# Relational Databases

#  Goals

+  Be able to read SQL code and have an understanding of what it is doing.
+  Be able to interact with an SQL/Relational database to get data from it.  Basics of SQL.
+  Perform some computations in the database and then process the results in R.
+  Understand when using a database is a good idea.


---
# Relational Database Management Systems - DBMS

+ Widely used in industry, academia
+ Data repository for an institution, company, etc.

+ Many (most) databases use a client-server model

+ Single centralized database running on a machine.
  + Many client applications (e.g., Excel, R, SAS, Python, Web browser) can simultaneously
           query the database.
  + Updating done centrally.
     +  Only need to update in a single place
     + Next time an application queries the DBMS, get the new, updated data.
     + All applications need to wait to ensure getting correct data.

---

# Large Data

+ Databases capable of handling very large data

+ Efficient computational model to query and combine data

+ Efficient storage
   +  Minimize redundancies of repeating the same value.


---
# Key Concepts

+ One database made up of one or more tables.

+ Merge records/rows across tables to create new tables/*views*.

---
# Tabular Data

+ A database is made up of related tables
+ Each table is rectangular

   + has rows and columns

   + like a data frame in R

   + rows/observations are called tuples

   + columns are called attributes

+ Order of the rows does not matter.

---
# Schema

+ Each table created with a SCHEMA

+ Columns have specified types

   + TEXT/VARCHAR, INTEGER, REAL, BOOL, BINARY, BLOB

+ Indicator for whether NA/NULL values are allowed


---
# Creating Databases

+ Simple to do basics

+ But need careful design to create efficient, flexible databases

+ Typically, statisticians &amp; data scientists  work with existing databases

   + extract data

   + less frequently insert data

   + much less common to design/build databases


---
# Avoiding Duplication in a Table.

+ Consider a University.

+ Students

+ Course

+ Instructors

+ Grades

---
# Student

+ First Name

+ Last Name

+ Major

+ Address1, Address2, Address3

   + street, city, state/country

+ Date enrolled

+ Date graduated

---
# Course

+ Subject  (e.g. STA)

+ Number  (e.g. 141B)

+ Instructor

+ Lecture Time

+ Title

+ Description

---
# Avoid Redundancy

+ Don't want to have

  + Student details repeated in each course

  + instructor name repeated for each student in the course

  + title and description repeated for each offering the same course across years

--
+ Put information in different tables
  + Student Metadata: SID, Name, Major, ...

  + Instructor Metadata: IID, Name, Department, ...

  + Course Metadata: CourseMeta ID, title and description, subject, number

  + Course Offerings:  CID, CourseMeta ID, IID, year, quarter
  + Class: tuples of  student-ID, CID
  + Rooms: tuples of CID, RoomID, Start & End times
  + Room Metadata:  RoomID, name, building, number, capacity

<!--
+ Instead of repeating, e.g., "Exact Duplicate", "Off-topic" etc. in millions of rows
  + Use index/category number
  + Exactly the same as factor() in R
   -->


---
# SQL

+ Pronounced sequel or spell out SQL

+ Language for querying the database

  + Domain Specific Language - like regular expressions

+ Declarative language

   + Say what you want to have happen

   + Not how to do it.

   + Not a regular programming language.

+ International Standard

  + Common core syntax, functionality.

  + However, each implementation/dialect has own additions

---
# SQLite

+ Standalone and embeded database

+ Stores tables in a file

+ Not a client-server model

  + Only single user at a time

+ Used in many applications, e.g. Firefox, OSX, ...

---
# SQLite in the Shell


+ I am using the cookies from my Firefox browser
```
~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/profiles/qszunwne.default/cookies.sqlite
```
  + Copied since it is locked when Firefox is running
  + I'll give you other databases to explore.


+ Shell/terminal command to run sqlite3
```shell
sqlite cookies.sqlite
```

---
# List tables
```
SQLite version 3.29.0 2019-07-10 17:32:03
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite>
```

+ Issue command
```
.tables
```
```
moz_cookies
```

---
# Show the Table Schema

```
.schema moz_cookies
```
```sql
CREATE TABLE moz_cookies(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                         originAttributes TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
                         name TEXT,
                         value TEXT,
                         host TEXT,
                         path TEXT,
                         expiry INTEGER,
                         lastAccessed INTEGER,
                         creationTime INTEGER,
                         isSecure INTEGER,
                         isHttpOnly INTEGER,
                         inBrowserElement INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
                         sameSite INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
                         rawSameSite INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
                         schemeMap INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
                       CONSTRAINT moz_uniqueid UNIQUE (name, host, path, originAttributes));
```

# SQL Queries directly (not from R)

+ SELECT is the primary operation

+ We'll find the number of rows
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM moz_cookies;
```

+ SELECT
   + the variable(s)
   + FROM
   + table name


+ COUNT is an example of an aggregate function
  + Processes all the rows and combines the values across rows to end up with a single row.
  + MIN, MAX, AVG

+ Note the ending `;`

---
# Rows

+ Get all rows for all columns/attributes in table
```sql
SELECT * FROM moz_cookies;
```

+ Get all rows for single column
```sql
SELECT host FROM moz_cookies;
```

+ Get unique/distinct entries in host
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT host FROM moz_cookies ;
```


+ Get counts for each host
```sql
SELECT host, COUNT(*) FROM moz_cookies GROUP BY host;
```

+ Filter/Condition rows
```sql
SELECT * FROM moz_cookies WHERE host = "www.nytimes.com";
```
```

# SQL and R

+ **Install** the DBI and RSQLite packages.
+ DBI provides a common interface to multiple database servers/engines
   + Same commands but implemented differently

+  Load the package
```r
library(RSQLite)
```

+ Connect to the database
```r
db = dbConnect(SQLite(), "cookies.sqlite")
```

---
# dbListTables() & dbListFields()

+ Names of the tables in the database
```r
dbListTables(db)
```

+ Names of the fields in a table
```r
dbListFields(db, "moz_cookies")
```
  + name of table


+ List fields of all tables
```r
lapply(dbListTables(db), function(tbl) dbListFields(db, tbl))
```


---
# SELECT Query - number of rows


+ R Command dbGetQuery()
```r
dbGetQuery(db, "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM moz_cookies")
```

+ 1st Argument - Connection to the database
  + Created one time
```r
db = dbConnect(SQLite(), "/path/to/sqlite/database/file")
```

+ 2nd Argument is SQL command as a string
  + Analogous to regular expression in `grep(rx, str)`
     + interpreted by regular expression engine.
     + not interpreted by R
