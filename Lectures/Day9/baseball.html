# In 2003, what were the three highest salaries?
 Who were the players receiving these salaries?
<!-- Q10 -->

---

```sql
SELECT salary 
FROM Salaries AS A
WHERE yearID = 2003 
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

--
+ This just gives the salaries

+ Can get the other columns in the Salaries table.

  + But doesn't have the player names.

---
# Getting the player information for these salaries

+ Join with the Master table

```sql  
SELECT * 
FROM Salaries AS A, Master AS B 
WHERE yearID = 2003 
  AND A.playerID = B.playerID 
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```


---
# Getting only the columns we want

```sql
SELECT   nameFirst || ' ' || nameLast AS Name,
         yearID,
         debut,
         salary,
         teamID,
         lgID
FROM Salaries AS A, Master AS B 
WHERE yearID = 2003 
  AND A.playerID = B.playerID 
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

+ Concatenate/paste the first and last name into a single string

+ Same as

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Salaries AS A
INNER JOIN Master AS B
ON A.playerID = B.playerID 
WHERE yearID = 2003 
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
---
# How do we include the name of the team

--

+ Need to join with Teams table

--

+ Caution: Not correct

```sql
SELECT   nameFirst || ' ' || nameLast AS Name,
         yearID,
         debut,
         salary,
         teamID,
         lgID,
         name
FROM Salaries AS A, Master AS B, Teams AS T
WHERE A.yearID = 2003 
  AND A.playerID = B.playerID
  AND T.teamID = A.teamID
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
```
  ambiguous column name: yearID
```

+ What's the problem(s)?

# From R

         debut,
         salary,
         A.teamID,
         A.lgID,
         T.name

Alex Rodriguez  2003    1994-07-08  22000000.0  TEX     AL    Texas Rangers
```

+ What's wrong?

---
# Add the Name of Team

--

+ Multiple rows in Teams for each team, but different years.

  + So T.teamID = A.teamID matches multiple rows for different year.

  + Need to restrict that `T.yearID = 2003`

     +   or equivalently  `T.yearID = A.yearID`

--

```sql
SELECT   nameFirst || ' ' || nameLast AS Name,
         A.yearID,
         debut,
         salary,
         A.teamID,
         A.lgID,
         T.name
FROM Salaries AS A, Master AS B, Teams AS T
WHERE A.yearID = 2003
  AND T.yearID = A.yearID                <---------
  AND A.playerID = B.playerID
  AND T.teamID = A.teamID
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

---
# Finding **all** the players with these salaries

+ In case of ties for salary, there may be more than three.

+ To get all of the players with these 3 salaries, we can use a nested query

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM  Salaries AS A, Master AS B  
WHERE yearID = 2003 AND A.playerID = B.playerID 
  AND salary IN (SELECT salary 
                   FROM Salaries 
			      WHERE yearID = 2003 
				ORDER BY salary DESC
                                LIMIT 3);
```

# What team *won* the World Series each year?
<!-- Q6  Zhaoyang did but doing it again to introduce SeriesPost table. -->
+ include the name of the team, league and division.

+ Which tables?

--
   + SeriesPost


--
+ Simple approach with only SeriesPost table

```sql
SELECT * FROM SeriesPost WHERE round = 'WS' LIMIT 10;
```

+ Just the winners
```
SELECT yearID, teamIDwinner, lgIDwinner, wins
FROM SeriesPost
WHERE round = 'WS'
ORDER BY yearID DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---
# Want the Team Name, etc.

+ Join on Teams

```sql
SELECT t.yearID, t.name, t.lgID, t.divID, s.teamIDloser
FROM SeriesPost AS s, 
     Teams AS t
WHERE s.yearID = t.yearID 
  AND s.round = 'WS'  
  AND s.teamIDwinner = t.teamID
ORDER BY t.yearID DESC
```

+ We included the ID of the losing team.
  + Want the Name of that team.


---
# Compute the table that has both the winner and runner-up for the World Series in each
tuple/row for all years

+ Include
  + the name of the team,
  + league and division,
  + the number of games the losing team won in the series.

<!-- Q8  -->

The result should look something like

```
yearID  name                     lgID  divID  name                     lgID  divID  losses
------  -----------------------  ----  -----  -----------------------  ----  -----  ------
2016    Chicago Cubs             NL    C      Cleveland Indians        AL    C      3     
2015    Kansas City Royals       AL    C      New York Mets            NL    E      1     
2014    San Francisco Giants     NL    W      Kansas City Royals       AL    C      3     
2013    Boston Red Sox           AL    E      St. Louis Cardinals      NL    C      3     
2012    San Francisco Giants     NL    W      Detroit Tigers           AL    C      0     
```

+ How do we go about doing this?

---
# Adding the losing team name


```sql
SELECT s.yearID, w.name, w.lgID, w.divID, 
                 l.name, l.lgID, l.divID, s.losses
FROM SeriesPost AS s, Teams AS w, Teams AS l
WHERE s.round = 'WS'
  AND s.yearID = w.yearID
  AND s.yearID = l.yearID  
  AND w.teamID = s.teamIDWinner
  AND l.teamID = s.teamIDLoser
ORDER BY s.yearID DESC;  
```


---
# Has the distribution of home runs for players increased over the years?

+ Maximum number of home runs by a single player?

+ Total number of home runs by all players?

--

```sql
SELECT yearID, MAX(HR) AS maxHR
FROM Batting
GROUP BY yearID
ORDER BY maxHR DESC;
```

---
# Total number of Home Runs by Year

```sql
SELECT yearID, MAX(HR) AS maxHR
FROM Batting
GROUP BY yearID
ORDER BY maxHR DESC;
```


---
# Total Team Salary by Year

+ Start simple

  + Look at the Salaries table
  + Group by teamID
  + Sum the salaries

+ Caution: Wrong
```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS payroll, yearID, teamID
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY teamID;
```

---
# Group by yearID and teamID

+ Summing across all years for a given team

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS payroll, yearID, teamID
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY teamID;
```

+ Probably want to reverse the order
```sql
ORDER BY yearID DESC
```

+ And probably by total salary

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS payroll, yearID, teamID
FROM Salaries
GROUP BY teamID
ORDER BY yearID DESC, payroll DESC;
```

---
# Want the team name, the league (NL or AL)

+ Approach

--

+ Join with the Teams table.

```sql
SELECT t.name, SUM(s.salary) AS payroll, s.yearID, t.teamID
FROM Salaries AS s,
     Teams AS t
WHERE s.yearID = t.yearID
  AND t.teamID = s.teamID
GROUP BY s.teamID, s.yearID
ORDER BY s.yearID DESC, payroll DESC;
```

---
# Challenge

+ Add a column indicating whether won the world series or not
