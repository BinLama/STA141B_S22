# Accessing the Lecture Materials

+ via git

# Finishing up the geolocation data.

+ Default value for readData() function
+ Breaking function into smaller, reusable, functions.
+ Debugging
+ Vectorized operations and improved speed/performance.

---
## Accessing the Lecture Materials

+ git repository
+ git is a version control system
  + like "track changes" in word processors, but much more general and powerful

+ Easier way to
  + update than downloading files
  + or track changes to your own code or general files
---

## From Command line in terminal
```
git clone https://github.com/duncantl/STA141B_S22
```
 + Do this once
 
+ Later, come back to this directory on your machine and issue the command
```
git pull
```
  + This gets new files and also updates any existing files with any changes


---
# Git Graphical Interfaces

+ [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
+ [sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)
+ [fork]()  Used to be free.
+ [List of others](https://www.fossmint.com/gui0git-cliennts-for-mac/)

## Default values for Function parameters

We considered writing our function as 
```r
readData = 
function(filename = "online")
{
 ll = readLines(filename)
  ...
}
```

---

What if we wrote it as 
```r
readData = 
function(filename = "online", ll = readLines(filename))
{
    ...
}
```
--

Almost exactly the same.

However, we can 
+ read the lines once, not each time
+ we can call readData() with a subset
  + smaller number of lines to check working
  + specific lines that are likely to show problems.

```r
ll = readLines("../Day3/online")
ans = readData(ll = ll[1:10])
```

+ Makes testing the code faster - less delay.

+ Generally good to allow caller customize the function
  + especially if the default  value allows them not to specify an argument.

---

# Decompose into Smaller Functions

+ Or build smaller functions first 
  + bottom up

+ Consider [line2DF](../Day3/mine.R) and [readData](../Day3/mine.R) we wrote on Tuesday

+ readData()
  + remove comment lines
    + make a separate function
	  + can use it ourselves interactively when reading the file

```
removeCommentLines =
function(x)
  x[ substring(x, 1, 1) != "#" ]
```

---
# General idea

+ Separate blocks of related code doing different tasks
+ Move to separate functions

+ In `line2DF()`
  + split the line into parts
  + get the fixed parts
  + get the detected device parts
  + for the detected device parts  (A)
     + split the strings by =
	 + get the MAC address
	 + split the second element of each device by ,
	 + get the signal, channel, type values
	 + combine into a data.frame
	 
  + for fixed part  (B)
     + get the values for t, id, pos and degree
	 + split the pos into x, y, z
  + add each fixed value as a column to data.frame

---
# For each item in the list above with sub-items (A and B)
   + make separate functions to perform the sub-steps
   + return the result
   
```r
mkDetectedDeviceDF =
function(ddev)
{
    els = strsplit(ddev, '=')
    mac = sapply(els, `[`, 1) # sapply(els, function(x) x[1])

    els2 = sapply(els, `[`, 2)
    els3 = strsplit(els2, ",")

    signal = sapply(els3, `[`, 1)
    channel = sapply(els3, `[`, 2)
    type = sapply(els3, `[`, 3)

    data.frame(mac, signal, channel, type, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
}
```

---
# Fixed part

+ extract the t, id, pos and degree values
+ split the pos into x, y, z

```r
getFixed = 
function(fixed, devDF)
{
    fixed = substring(fixed, c(3, 4, 5, 8))
    pos.xyz = strsplit(fixed[3], ",")[[1]]
	
    structure(c(fixed[c(1, 3, 4)], pos.xyz),
              names = c("t", "id", "degree", "x", "y", "z"))
}
```

---
# Simplified line2DF()

+ Now we can write line2DF() as 
```r
line2DF =
function(x)
{
    parts = strsplit(x, ";")[[1]]
    ans = mkDetectedDeviceDF(parts[ - (1:4) ])
    fxd = getFixed(parts[ 1:4 ])	
    ans[ names(fxd) ] = as.list(fxd)
    ans
}
```

+ Each is much easier to read and more focused
+ The names indicate what they do, not how they do it.
+ We can test each function individually/separately.

---
# Note

+ Note how we append the fixed part to the device data.frame
```r
ans[ names(fxd) ] = as.list(fxd)
```

+ Why does this work?


+ Alternative for adding fixed columns
```r
for(v in names(fxd))
	ans[[v]] = fxd[v]
```

+ If we used the for loop approach, why can we not use lapply()/sapply() instead ?

---
# Vectorization

+ Consider transforming the detected device "parts"
   + for a given line in the file into a data.frame/matrix.


+ We split by `=`
+ then got the mac address - `sapply(els, "[", 1)`
+ then got the second part - "signal, channel, type" as a string
+ then split this
+ then got the signal, then the channe, then the type.
+ combine into a data.frame via `data.frame()`/`cbind()`


---
# Alternative Approach

+ Instead, what if we could arrange the values into matrix/data.frame/tabular structure "directly"

```r
ddev = c("00:14:bf:b1:97:8a=-43,2437000000,3", "00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0=-52,2462000000,3", 
         "00:14:bf:3b:c7:c6=-62,2432000000,3", "00:14:bf:b1:97:81=-58,2422000000,3", 
         "00:14:bf:b1:97:8d=-62,2442000000,3", "00:14:bf:b1:97:90=-57,2427000000,3", 
         "00:0f:a3:39:e0:4b=-79,2462000000,3", "00:0f:a3:39:e2:10=-88,2437000000,3", 
         "00:0f:a3:39:dd:cd=-64,2412000000,3", "02:64:fb:68:52:e6=-87,2447000000,1", 
         "02:00:42:55:31:00=-85,2457000000,1")

ivals = unlist(strsplit(unlist(strsplit(ddev, "=")), ","))

d = matrix(ivals, , 4, byrow = TRUE)
d = as.data.frame(d, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

---
# Process All Detected Devices in a Single Step?

+ What if we could do this for all lines - only on the detected device parts.

```r
ll = readLines("../Day3/online")
ll = ll[!grepl("^#", ll)]
parts = strsplit(ll, ";")

addev = lapply(parts, `[`, -(1:4))

    # check result is meaningful/as we expect
nddev = sapply(addev, length)
table(nddev)

tmp = unlist(strsplit(unlist(strsplit(unlist(addev), "=")), ","))

  # Even better but using regular expressions.
tmp2 = unlist(strsplit(unlist(addev), "[=,]"))
identical(tmp, tmp2)

ddev = matrix(tmp, , 4, byrow = TRUE)

dim(ddev)
```

+ Exactly the number of rows we got with our original function.

---
# Processing the Fixed Part in One Step
 
+ Now deal with all of the fixed data and combine those into a 
  matrix with as many rows as there are (non-comment) lines in the file.

```r
fixed = lapply(parts, `[`, 1:4)
fx = matrix(unlist(strsplit(unlist(fixed), "[=,]")), , 10, byrow = TRUE)
fx = fx[, c(2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10)]
```
+ we extracted the values and omitted the names t, id, pos, degree


---
# Combine the Fixed and Detected Device

+ Next, map each fixed to the corresponding rows in the ddev data.frame/matrix
   + repeating each row as many times as there are detected devices on that line of the file
   
```
i = rep(seq(along.with = parts), nddev)

length(i)

ans = cbind(fx[i,], ddev)
```

---
# Validate/Verify Results

+ Check if this works
```r
source("../Day3/mine.R")
a1 = readData("../Day3/online")
source("vectorize.R")
a2 = readData("../Day3/online")
```

```r
identical(a1, a2)
```
+ FALSE

---
# In what way not the same?

```r
all.equal(a1, a2)
 [1] "Names: 10 string mismatches"          
 [2] "Component 1: 53303 string mismatches" 
 [3] "Component 2: 53303 string mismatches" 
 [4] "Component 3: 53303 string mismatches" 
 [5] "Component 4: 53303 string mismatches" 
 [6] "Component 5: 53303 string mismatches" 
 [7] "Component 6: 53303 string mismatches" 
 [8] "Component 7: 53303 string mismatches" 
 [9] "Component 8: 53303 string mismatches" 
[10] "Component 9: 53303 string mismatches" 
[11] "Component 10: 53303 string mismatches"
```

+ Columns are in different order.
  + No names on result from vectorize.R.
  
+ See vectorize1.R
```r
source("vectorize1.R")
a2 = readData("../Day3/online")

identical(a1, a2[names(a1)])
```

---
# Speed/Performance


+ How fast are the functions

```r
source("../Day3/mine.R")
tm1 = replicate(5, system.time(readData("../Day3/online")))
source("vectorize1.R")
tm2 = replicate(5, system.time(readData("../Day3/online")))
```

```
median(tm1[3,])/median(tm2[3,])
boxplot(list(tm1["elapsed",], tm2["elapsed",]))
```
   + So speed up of about 8.67


---

# Can we do better?

+ Find out where at is taking time

```r
Rprof("tm.prof")
invisible(replicate(5, readData("../Day3/online")))
Rprof(NULL)
```
   + changes each time.
   + Run more replications, e.g., 25

---
# Profile Results
   
```r
head(summaryRprof("tm.prof")$by.self, 20)
                 self.time self.pct total.time total.pct
"strsplit"            9.58    85.08       9.60     85.26
"readLines"           0.46     4.09       0.50      4.44
"as.vector"           0.32     2.84       0.32      2.84
"unlist"              0.24     2.13       6.40     56.84
"lapply"              0.20     1.78      11.26    100.00
"cbind"               0.18     1.60       0.18      1.60
"matrix"              0.10     0.89       1.34     11.90
"removeComments"      0.04     0.36       0.56      4.97
"colnames<-"          0.04     0.36       0.04      0.36
"unique.default"      0.04     0.36       0.04      0.36
"%in%"                0.02     0.18       0.04      0.36
"options"             0.02     0.18       0.02      0.18
"substring"           0.02     0.18       0.02      0.18
```

+ So strsplit is taking 85% of the time.
+ 3 calls to strsplit(), when we look at the code.

---
# Splitting values in one call to `strsplit()`

What if we split the fixed and detected devices in one call to strsplit?
Result is more complicated but can we then extract the pieces we want for
the two data.frames

Consider 3 sample lines  `ll[3]`.

What if we can  make one call to strsplit
+ split all values by ; = and , for each line
+ extract the fixed element values
+ extract and assemble the detected devices


+ see [vectorize2.R](vectorize2.R)

# Timings

```r
source("vectorize2.R")
tm3 = replicate(5, system.time(readData("../Day3/online")))
```

+ Speedup?
```
median(tm2[3,])/median(tm3[3,])
```
 +  About 72% as long, speedup factor of 1.37

```r
tm = data.frame(elapsedTime = c(tm1[3,], tm2[3, ], tm3[3,]), 
                version = factor(rep(c("mine", "vectorize1", "vectorize2"), each = ncol(tm1))))

boxplot(elapsedTime ~ version, tm)
```

---
# Timings

![timings](timings.png)



---
# Debugging

+ Go back to
```r
source("../Day3/mine.R")
```

+ Then run
```r
readData("../Day3/onlineProblem")
```

```
Error in strsplit(els2, ",") : non-character argument

Enter a frame number, or 0 to exit   

1: readData("../Day3/onlineProblem")
2: mine.R#7: lapply(ll, line2DF)
